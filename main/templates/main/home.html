  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I’m Avigyan, an undergraduate in the
    <strong>B.Stat (Hons)</strong> program at
    <strong>ISI Kolkata</strong>, Class of
    <strong>2028</strong>. This is my personal website —
    a curated collection of academic notes, personal
    reflections (both academic and non-academic),
    and a growing archive of typesetting
    and grammatical pet peeves.

  <h1 id="about-me" class="anchored">About me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a minimalist and perfectionist whom
      you can often find fiddling with LaTeX
      and writing scripts to make my workflow
      smoother.
      My current obsession is
      analyzing and rewriting third party scripts
      to better suit my setup. I mostly work in
      Python, so most of my scripts
      are written in it. Apart from that,
      I sometimes dabble in
      web-development as well.
      Last but not the least — I use Arch BTW.
      You can find
      my Dotfiles at the 
      <a
        href="https://github.com/Bubu-Droid/dotfiles"
        target="_blank"
      >GitHub repository</a>.
      I usually go by <strong>Bubu-Droid</strong> online.
      On (AoPS), I’m known as <strong>kamatadu</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not crunching numbers or jabbing my
      fingers at the keyboard, I enjoy playing the
      bansuri (still learning), watching anime
      (my
      <a 
        href="https://anilist.co/user/BubuDroid/"
        target="_blank">AniList profile</a>), and
      play video games.
      I also watch motovlogs, listen to
      music,
      and recently got back into
      Clash of Clans (you can find
      me at <code>#POJCRJJUY</code> and
      <code>#9U2UPJ8R9</code>).
      I also have a YouTube channel,
      which you can find
      <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/@bubu-droid"
        target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I listen to music a lot and I’m
      currently working
      on migrating my playlist of
      over 1000 Liked Songs
      from Spotify to YouTube Music
      (yes, Spotify sucks) and sorting them
      based on my arbitrary and biased
      decision-making (did you get the reference?).
      Currently, these two temporary
      playlists are available
    </p>

    <ul class="ul-left-bar li-right-arrow ul-lower-gap">
      <li>
        <a
        href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYljaexxmCtPnh6C4k_Cvs4wRYal8jpa7&si=hOP8ke5R_jLNuOiF"
        target="_blank"
      >Heart Touching Songs</a></li>
      <li>
        <a
        href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYljaexxmCtNzcq6nDrJ-SCY8qpyiOFKl&si=zE58M8HQ8O1cF8RV"
        target="_blank"
      >Nostalgic Songs</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I consider these as temporary because my music taste
      has evolved a lot since the time I first made
      them.

      The final playlists are to be made available here
    </p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      I also have an ongoing playlist
      dedicated entirely to flute covers
      which you can find here
