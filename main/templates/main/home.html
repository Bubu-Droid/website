  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I’m Avigyan Chakraborty, an undergraduate in the
    <strong>B.Stat (Hons)</strong> program at
    <strong>ISI Kolkata</strong>, Class of
    <strong>2028</strong>. This is my personal website
    which contains a
    curated collection of academic notes, personal
    reflections (both academic and non-academic),
    and a growing archive of typesetting
    and grammatical pet peeves.

  <h1 id="about-me" class="anchored">About me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a math and CS enthusiast whom
      you can often find fiddling with LaTeX,
      solving problems from contests, and
      writing scripts to make my workflow
      smoother. I mostly work in
      Python, so most of my scripts
      are written in it. Apart from that,
      I sometimes dabble in
      web-development as well.
      Last but not the least, I use Arch BTW.
      You can find
      my Dotfiles at the 
      <a
        href="https://github.com/Bubu-Droid/dotfiles"
        target="_blank"
      >GitHub repository</a>.
      I usually go by <strong>Bubu-Droid</strong> online.
      On (AoPS), I’m known as
      <a
        href="https://aops.com/community/user/784223"
      target="_blank"
      >kamatadu</a>.
      Other accounts of mine (most of which are already banned)
      on AoPS include

    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not crunching numbers or jabbing my
      fingers at the keyboard, I enjoy playing the
      bansuri (still learning), watch anime
      (my
      <a 
        href="https://anilist.co/user/BubuDroid/"
        target="_blank">AniList profile</a>), and
      play video games. I’m currently learning how to edit
      videos using Davinci Resolve.
      I also watch motovlogs, a LOT of AMVs,
      and listen to music.
      I used be an avid Clash of Clans player; you can find
      me at <code>#POJCRJJUY</code> and
      <code>#9U2UPJ8R9</code>.
      I also have a YouTube channel,
      which you can find
      <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/@bubu-droid"
        target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I listen to music a lot and I’m
      currently working
      on migrating my playlist of
      over 1000 Liked Songs
      from Spotify to YouTube Music
      (yes, Spotify sucks) and sorting them
      based on my arbitrary and biased
      decision-making (did you get the reference?).
      Currently, these two temporary
      playlists are available:
    </p>

    <ul class="li-left-bar ul-lower-gap">
      <li>
        <a
        href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYljaexxmCtPnh6C4k_Cvs4wRYal8jpa7&si=hOP8ke5R_jLNuOiF"
        target="_blank"
      >Heart Touching Songs</a></li>
      <li>
        <a
        href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYljaexxmCtNzcq6nDrJ-SCY8qpyiOFKl&si=zE58M8HQ8O1cF8RV"
        target="_blank"
      >Nostalgic Songs</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I consider these as temporary because my music taste
      has evolved a lot since the time I first made
      them.

      The final playlists are to be made available here:
    </p>

      Recently, me and
      <a
        href="https://aops.com/community/user/965124"
        target="_blank"
      >Samyak</a> started collecting
      nostalgic NCS, Trap Nation, and other similar
      music that bring back memories from the 2017
      middle school
      days, when we used to run YouTube channels hoping to
      be famous overnight 😂. You can find our collaborative
      playlist here:
